= timew-import(1)

== NAME
timew-import - import time-tracking data from files

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
*timew import* [_<file>_**...**]

== DESCRIPTION
Import tracked time from `file`.
If no files are specified, the command will read from standard input.

The data to import has to be in JSON format, as exported by *link:../../reference/timew-export*.1/[link:../../reference/timew-export*.1/[link:../../reference/timew-export*.1/[link:../../reference/timew-export*.1/[link:../../reference/timew-export*.1/[*timew-export**(1)]]]]], i.e. a single array with interval objects.

When importing, the intervals are checked for overlaps with existing intervals.
If an overlap is found, the import will abort at the first overlap and no more intervals are imported, unless the `:adjust` hint is specified.

In general, it is recommended to create a backup of your data before importing.

== HINTS

**:adjust**::
When given, the imported interval will overwrite any existing intervals that it overlaps with.

== EXAMPLES

*Import intervals from a file*::
+
Import intervals from a single file:
+
[source]
----
timew import intervals.json
----
+
Any file path that does not start with a `/` is interpreted as relative to the current working directory.

*Import intervals from multiple files*::
+
One can also use shell wildcards and absolute paths:
+
[source]
----
timew import /path/to/intervals/*.json
----

*Import intervals from standard input*::
+
Import intervals from stdin:
+
[source]
----
timew export | ssh <server> 'timew import'
----
This is especially useful for synchronizing intervals between different machines.
