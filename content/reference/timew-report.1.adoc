== NAME
timew-report - run an extension report

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
*timew* [*report*] _<report>_ [_<range>_] [_<tag>_**...**]

== DESCRIPTION
Runs an extension report, and supports filtering data.
The 'report' command itself is optional, which means that these two commands are equivalent:

    $ timew report foo :week
    $ timew        foo :week

This does however assume there is a 'foo' extension installed.
