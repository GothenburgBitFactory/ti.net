= timew-ranges(7)

== NAME
timew-ranges - date and time ranges supported by Timewarrior

== SYNOPSIS

== DESCRIPTION
An interval defines a block of time that is tracked.
The syntax for specifying an interval is flexible, and may be one of:

  [from] <date>
  [from] <date> to/- <date>
  [from] <date> for <duration>
  <duration> before/after <date>
  <duration> ago
  [for] <duration>

Examples are:

  from 9:00
  from 9am - 11am
  from 9:00:00 to 11:00
  from 9:00 for 2h
  2h after 9am
  2h before 11:00
  2h ago
  for 2h

An interval is called 'closed' if there is both a start date and an end date, and 'open' if there is no end date.

There is also a number of useful hints for common ranges.
