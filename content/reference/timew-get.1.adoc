= timew-get(1)

== NAME
timew-get - display DOM values

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
*timew get* _<DOM>_**...**

== DESCRIPTION
Validates the DOM reference, then obtains the value and displays it.

In case of an invalid reference an error message is displayed on stderr and the exit code is 1.

All DOM references start with `dom`, there are 4 subreferences that can be accessed:

- `dom.tracked`, all intervals
- `dom.active`, active time tracking
- `dom.tags`, all tags
- `dom.rc`, configuration settings

See link:../../reference/timew-config.7/[*timew-config*(7)] for more details on those.
It is an error to reference an interval or tag that does not exist.

If more than one valid DOM reference is given, the results are concatenated by a space.

== EXAMPLES

Query current time tracking::

  $ timew get dom.active
  1
+
This query returns `1` if time tracking is active, `0` if not.

Display the 3rd interval of a query as JSON::

For the `dom.tracked` reference filtering by range and tags can be applied:
+
  $ timew get dom.tracked.3.json :month FOO
  {"id":42,"start":"20250802T101224Z","end":"20250802T101224Z","tags":["FOO","BAR"]}
+
Note that the `3` in the reference refers to the 3rd interval in the query result, not the interval with ID `3`!
