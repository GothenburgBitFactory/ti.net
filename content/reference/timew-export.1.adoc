= timew-export(1)

== NAME
timew-export - export tracked time in JSON

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
*timew export* [ _<id>_**...** | ([_<range>_] [_<tag>_**...**]) ]

== DESCRIPTION
Exports all the tracked time in JSON format.

Supply either a list of interval IDs, or a range and/or tag filter (see *timew-ranges**(7) and *link:../../reference/timew-tags.1/[*timew-tags*(1)]) to export only a subset of intervals.

The data is exported as a JSON array of interval objects, each containing the start time, end time, current id, tags, and annotation of the interval, if present.

== EXAMPLES

*Export all intervals*::
+
Calling the `export` command without any arguments exports all tracked intervals in JSON format:
+
[source]
----
$ timew export
[
{"id":2,"start":"20231001T103000Z","end":"20231001T120000Z","tags":["work"],"annotation":"Project work"},
{"id":1,"start":"20231001T090000Z","end":"20231001T100000Z","tags":["work"],"annotation":"Morning meeting"},
]
----
+
In this example, only two intervals are present in the database.
The output is sorted by start time, with the oldest interval first.

*Export intervals filtered by range and tag*::
+
[source]
----
$ timew export from 2016-01-01 for 3wks tag1
...
----

*Export intervals by their ids*::
+
[source]
----
$ timew export @1 @3 @7
...
