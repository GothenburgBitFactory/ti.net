= timew-track(1)

== NAME
timew-track - add intervals to the database

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
*timew track* _<range>_ [_<tag>_**...**]

== DESCRIPTION
The track command is used to add tracked time in the past.
Perhaps you forgot to record time, or are just filling in old entries.

== HINTS
Apart from range hints (see link:../../reference/timew-hints.7/[*timew-hints*(7)]), the track command accepts the following hints:

**:fill**::
The ':fill' hint can be used to create a new interval that fills the gap between two adjacent intervals.

== EXAMPLES
*Recording a closed interval*::

For example:
+
    $ timew track :yesterday 'Training Course'
    $ timew track 9am - 11am 'Staff Meeting'
+
Note that the track command expects a closed interval (start and end time), when recording.
If a closed interval is not provided, the 'track' command behaves the same as the 'start' command.

*Filling the gap between two intervals*::
To fill the gap between two intervals, without having to specify the exact times, one can use the :fill hint.
When e.g. the first interval ends some time before 10:00 and the second interval starts some time after 11:00, calling
+
    $ timew track 10:00 - 11:00 :fill 'Coffee Break'
+
will instruct Timewarrior to expand the interval such that it starts right after the first interval and ends right before the second interval.
