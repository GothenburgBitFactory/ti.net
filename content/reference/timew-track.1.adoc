= timew-track(1)

== NAME
timew-track - add intervals to the database

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
*timew track* _<range>_ [_<tag>_**...**]

== DESCRIPTION
The track command is used to add tracked time in the past.
Perhaps you forgot to record time, or are just filling in old entries.

== EXAMPLES
For example:

    $ timew track :yesterday 'Training Course'
    $ timew track 9am - 11am 'Staff Meeting'

Note that the track command expects a closed interval (start and end time), when recording.
If a closed interval is not provided, the 'track' command behaves the same as the 'start' command.
