= timew-gaps(1)

== NAME
timew-gaps - display time tracking gaps

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
*timew gaps* [_<range>_] [_<tag>_**...**]

== DESCRIPTION
Displays a summary of time that is neither tracked nor excluded from tracking.

The 'reports.gaps.range' configuration setting overrides the default date range.
The ':blank' hint causes only the excluded time to be shown, with no tracked time.
The default date range shown is ':day'.

== HINTS
Apart from range hints (see link:../../reference/timew-hints.7/[*timew-hints*(7)]), the gaps report adheres to the following hints:

**:blank**::
Show only the time that is excluded from tracking, without showing any tracked time.

== CONFIGURATION
**reports.gaps.range**::
For reports that show a range of data, this setting will override the default value.
The value should be a range hint, see link:../../reference/timew-hints.7/[*timew-hints*(7)].
