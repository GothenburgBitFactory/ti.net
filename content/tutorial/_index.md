# Beginners Tutorial

This tutorial will give you a good basic understanding of how to use Timewarrior.

It is divided into several sections, each covering a different aspect of Timewarrior.
They kind of build upon each other, so it is recommended to follow them in order.

All examples in this tutorial were made with Timewarrior version `1.9.0`.
If you are using a different version, the output might differ.

 * [Running Timewarrior for the very first time](first_light/)
 * [Some simple time tracking](simple/)
 * [Displaying the collected data](summary/)
 * [Enhancing time tracking with tags](enhanced/)
 * [Adding metadata information](metadata/)
 * [A bit more precise time tracking](precise/)
 * [Undoing what has been done](undo/)
 * [Correcting mistakes](corrections/)
