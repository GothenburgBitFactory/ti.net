## Themes

Timewarrior has color themes that are mostly used by the charts to color the different parts of the display.
To use a color theme, add this line to your `~/.timewarrior/timewarrior.cfg` file with a text editor:

```console
import /path/to/themes/dark_green.theme
```

Note that the path `/path/to/themes` is a placeholder.
Your installation will likely use a path more like this, but it should be noted that this path varies depending on platform and the wishes of the packager.

```console
import /usr/local/share/doc/timew/doc/themes/dark_green.theme
```

There are a few simple themes available initially, but this collection will grow and improve.
Timewarrior is also likely to make greater use of themes in future releases.
