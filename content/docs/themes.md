# Themes

Timewarrior uses color, and supports color themes.
The colors are used for assorted highlighting, and for coloring tags on charts.
Themes are optional, but can improve your experience.

To use a theme, you need a line added to your `~/.timewarrior/timewarrior.cfg` file, like this:

```console
import /usr/local/share/doc/timew/themes/dark.theme
```

That path is platform-dependent, so yours may differ.

There are four themes included in the release: `dark.theme`, `dark_red.theme`, `dark_green.theme`, and `dark_blue.theme`.
Consider making your own and sharing.
