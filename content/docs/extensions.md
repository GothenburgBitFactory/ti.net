## Extensions

Timewarrior has an [Extension mechanism](/docs/api) that permits the authoring and sharing of arbitrary reports.

Using the `extensions` command, you can list installed extensions:

    $ timew extensions
    ...

Additionally the [`diagnostics`](/docs/diagnostics) command will list installed extensions.
