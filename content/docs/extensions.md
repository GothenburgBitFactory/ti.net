### Extensions

Timewarrior has an [Extension mechanism](/docs/api.html) that permits
the authoring and sharing of arbitrary reports.

Using the `extensions` command, you can list installed extensions:

    $ timew extensions
    ...

Additionally the [`diagnostics`](/docs/diagnostics.html) command will
list installed extensions.
