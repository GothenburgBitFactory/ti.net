# Extensions

Timewarrior has an [Extension mechanism](../api/) that permits the authoring and sharing of arbitrary reports.

Using the `extensions` command, you can list installed extensions:

```
$ timew extensions
...
```

Additionally, the [`diagnostics`](../diagnostics/) command will list installed extensions.
