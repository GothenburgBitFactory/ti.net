## What does Timewarrior do?

{{< lead >}}Timewarrior tracks and reports time from the command line.{{< /lead >}}

Timewarrior is a command line time tracking application, which allows you to record time spent on activities.
You may be tracking your time because your work requires it, or simply for curiosity.

## Why do I need Timewarrior?

We are not trying to convince you to track your time.
But if you already do, or want to begin, then Timewarrior aims to be your preferred choice.

Timewarrior allows you to track your time from any shell you have at hand, no need for a permanent running application.
It tracks your time and then gets out of your way.

You will be able to track your time intelligently, and then later generate useful visual or tabular reports of that time.
Built-in reports, as well as an extension API allowing to process your data with any programming language will give you plenty of options.

So if you are looking for a simple, yet powerful time tracking solution, Timewarrior is for you.

Give Timewarrior a try (see [How to install Timewarrior](../install/)) and see if it fits your needs.
